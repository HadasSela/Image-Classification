# Image-Classification

In this assignment, we will build a convolutional neural network that can predict 
whether two shoes are from the **same pair** or from two **different pairs**.
This kind of application can have real-world applications: for example to help
people who are visually impaired to have more independence.

We will explore two convolutional architectures.
